This repository contains sample code for [Unfolded](https://unfolded.ai) APIs, including

- [Unfolded Map SDK](https://docs.unfolded.ai/map-sdk)

## Unfolded Map SDK

![Map SDK Preview](images/out.gif)

The Unfolded map SDK lets you embed and control Unfolded maps from

- Your own web pages, using the [JavaScript Map SDK](https://docs.unfolded.ai/map-sdk/javascript-map-sdk).
- Jupyter notebooks, using the [Python Map SDK](https://docs.unfolded.ai/map-sdk/python-map-sdk).

The Map SDK makes it easy to:

- Do exploratory geospatial analytics and data science in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Build web pages that embed published Unfolded Studio maps.
- Create bespoke styling and interactions for Unfolded Studio maps.
- Integrate Unfolded maps into your organization's workflows.

In the [/map-sdk](/map-sdk) directory you can find examples on how to use our Unfolded's Map SDK with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frameworks.
All of the examples are based on the respective framework's starter projects with the added Unfolded's Map SDK integration.

Some of the following features are included in the examples:
- Create and include the Unfolded Studio map in your project
- Get the information about the available map layers
- Set the layer visibility (show/hide)
- Set the map's view state - position the view on a certain location with the provided zoom level
