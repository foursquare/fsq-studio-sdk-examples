This repository contains sample code for [Foursquare Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/) SDKs, including:

- [Studio Map SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/studio-map-sdk-introduction)
- [Studio Data SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/data-sdk-introduction)

## Studio Map SDK

The Studio Map SDK lets you embed and control [Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/) maps from:

- Your own web pages, using the [Typescript Map SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/studio-map-sdk-setup-guide#javascript-setup)
- Jupyter notebooks, using the [Python Map SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/studio-map-sdk-setup-guide#python-setup)

The Map SDK makes it easy to:

- Do exploratory geospatial analytics and data science in Jupyter Notebooks
- Build web pages that embed published Foursquare Studio maps
- Create bespoke styling and interactions for Foursquare Studio maps
- Integrate Studio maps into your organization's workflows

## Studio Data SDK

The Studio Data SDK is a Python library that provides APIs to access the [Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/) platform, allowing your applications to:

- Authenticate with the Studio platform
- Access your geospatial assets (such as maps and datasets)
- Invoke Studio analytics services such as enrichment from your own applications
- Start pipeline tasks for bulk processing of geospatial data
