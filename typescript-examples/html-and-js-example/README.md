# Map SDK example with HTML and JS

This example demonstrates how to work with Map SDK without any framework or bundler available, in a pure JS and HTML setup.

This is an example for Foursquare's [Map SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/studio-map-sdk-introduction) that allows you to programmatically render [Foursquare Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/) maps within your website and with your own data.
