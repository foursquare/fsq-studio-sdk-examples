# Map SDK basic example

This example demonstrates how to load an empty map.

This is an example for Foursquare's [Map SDK](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/docs/studio-map-sdk-introduction) that allows you to programmatically render [Foursquare Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/) maps within your website and with your own data.

The project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
By default, the app is available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

The page will reload when you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds and bundles the app for production into the `dist` folder.

### `yarn preview`

Runs a server to locally preview the production build.

If you don't use `yarn dev`, you likely would want to use `yarn build` and `yarn preview` together.
